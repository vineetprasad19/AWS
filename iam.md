# IAM: Identity and Access Management  

- When accessing AWS, the root account should **never** be used. Users must be created with the proper permissions. IAM is central to AWS  
- **Users**: A physical person  
- **Groups**: Functions (admin, devops) Teams (engineering, design) which contain a group of users  
- **Roles**: Internal usage within AWS resources  
    - **Cross Account Roles**: roles used to assumed by another AWS account in order to have access to some resources in our account  
- **Policies (JSON documents)**: Defines what each of the above can and cannot do. **Note**: IAM has predefined managed policies  
    - There are 3 types of policies:  
        - AWS Managed  
        - Customer Managed  
        - Inline Policies  
- **Resource Based Policies**: policies attached to AWS services such as S3, SQS  

## IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies  

- When we assume a role (user, application or service), we give up our original permission and take the permission assigned to the role  
- When using a resource based policy, principal does not have to give up any permissions  
- Example: user in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in account B. In this case if we assume a role in account B, we wont be able to scan the table in account A  
  
## Best practices  

- One IAM User per person **ONLY**  
- One IAM Role per Application  
- IAM credentials should **NEVER** be shared  
- Never write IAM credentials in your code. **EVER**  
- Never use the ROOT account except for initial setup  
- It's best to give users the minimal amount of permissions to perform their job
